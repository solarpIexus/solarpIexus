   ⭒ I'm actually a quiet and level-headed person, as you might think... It's hard for me to keep up a conversation with anyone other than my close friends (!!!).
   But if you still want to write, I'll be happy (^_+.) --- __Just please keep my words in mind__
  - and yes, it's okay to communicate to me (c+h)! But it's better to check if I'm with friends at the moment, as I would prefer you not to do so,,,
   - I'm always honest about my feelings. If I feel uncomfortable, I'll be straightforward and end the conversation... Therefore, please be mindful of your words. I won't pretend that everything is fine if I smell bad vibes. Isn't it better to be honest with each other from the start, Right? ◜◡◝₊
   - My ***[Carrd](https://endysteaparty.carrd.co)*** is like a draft that's always in progress! It's not perfect, and there's not a lot of information, but if you want to get to know me a little better, this is the place for __you__     - Because the most important thing there is __me__!!!!! (✿◡‿⊹.)
