   ⭒ I'm actually a quiet and level-headed person, as you might think... It's hard for me to keep up a conversation with anyone other than my close friends (!!!)
   But if you still want to write __(w2i phleeazie(t_t))__, then,,,, why not?!?   --- __Just please keep my words in mind__
   - *.  My ***[Carrd](https://endysteaparty.carrd.co)*** is like a draft that's always in progress! It's not perfect, and there's not a lot of information, but if you want to get to know me a little better, this is the place for __you__     - Because the most important thing there is __me__!!!!!
